Looking at the logs, there are two issues:

The server is running but authentication is failing because there's no registered user with those credentials
Port 5000 might need to be exposed for external access
Let's fix both:

First, let's register a user since the login is failing:
server/auth.ts
Add console logging for registration
Next, let's update the server to bind to 0.0.0.0:
server/index.ts
Update server binding
Try registering a new user at /auth first, then attempt to login with those credentials. The logs will help verify if the registration was successful.

the registration of the user won't happen in the login screen but from user add pgae by an admin user

I understand - we need to update the auth flow to handle registration through the admin user management page instead of the login screen. Let's remove the registration form from the auth page and update the implementation.

The error logs indicate that the login request is missing required fields. Looking at the login attempt, only password is being sent, but the username field is missing according to the login schema in server/auth.ts.

Let's update the auth page to ensure both username and password are sent correctly:

client/src/pages/auth-page.tsx
This change ensures the form sends the username (email) field that matches the server's login schema requirements. The server expects username instead of email in the request body.

The 401 Unauthorized error occurs when trying to access /api/user endpoint, which suggests there's no valid authentication token being sent with the request. Let's fix this by ensuring the token is properly managed and sent with requests.

Looking at your token management in client/src/lib/queryClient.ts, the issue seems to be with token handling. Let's ensure that the Authorization header is properly set with the token:

client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
Also, let's update the auth hook to ensure login data is properly formatted:

client/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx
The changes ensure:

The Authorization header is properly formatted
Login credentials match the server's expected format (username instead of email)
Token is properly passed to subsequent requests
This should resolve the 401 errors you're seeing.

The 401 Unauthorized error occurs because the authorization header is not being properly set in the API requests. Let's fix this by updating the queryClient.ts file to properly handle the authorization header:

client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
This change ensures proper token handling and redirects to the auth page on unauthorized requests.

Yes, the token should be created after a successful login. Looking at your code, let's check the login flow in use-auth.tsx:

client/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx
Let's also update the queryClient to better handle auth headers:

client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
These changes will ensure proper token handling and help debug the auth flow. After login, check the browser console to confirm the token is being set.

The error shows that the login request is failing because the token is not being provided and the login data is invalid. Let's fix this by updating the login mutation in use-auth.tsx to match the server's expected format:

client/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx
server/auth.ts
These changes ensure:

The login request uses the correct field name (username instead of email)
The server validates login data properly
The token will be set correctly after successful login

The 401 Unauthorized error occurs because the API request to /api/user is being made without a valid authentication token. This happens when:

You're not logged in yet
The token is not being properly stored after login
The token is not being properly sent with the request
Looking at your code, let's improve the error handling in the login mutation and add better token validation:

client/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx
Improve login error handling
This change will help identify if the token is being properly stored after login. Check the browser console for any error messages when trying to log in.

The 401 Unauthorized error occurs because the AuthProvider in your React app is making an initial request to /api/user to check if there's an authenticated user, even before login. This is expected behavior, but we can improve the error handling to make it more graceful.

Let's update the query configuration to handle this case better:

client/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx
Improve auth query error handling
This change will:

Prevent unnecessary retries when not authenticated
Stop refetching on window focus
Still allow the auth check to work as intended
The 401 error in the console is normal before login - it just means there's no valid authentication token yet.

the login button doesn't work

Looking at your codebase, the issue seems to be with how the login form is connecting to the auth system. Let's fix the login form schema and validation:

client/src/pages/auth-page.tsx
client/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx
These changes:

Fix the login form schema to match the form fields
Add better error handling and logging
Ensure proper headers are sent with the request
Try logging in again - you should see more detailed error messages in the console if anything fails.

I can see from the logs that the login attempt is failing with invalid credentials. The issue is that your login form is sending test@test.gr as the email, but in the server's auth implementation, we're expecting the username field to match exactly what's in the database.

Let's fix this by updating the server-side login validation:

server/auth.ts
Make sure that:

The email in your database matches the one you're trying to log in with
The password meets the minimum length requirement (6 characters)
The user account exists in the database
You can also try with a known working test account or check the database to verify the credentials.

KK

Looking at your code, the password comparison is happening correctly using bcrypt on the server side in auth.ts. However, let's add some additional logging to help debug the authentication process:

server/auth.ts
This will help us see if the password comparison is working correctly. The error you're seeing suggests either:

The password hash in the database doesn't match
The raw password being sent isn't being processed correctly
Try logging in again and check the server logs for the password validation results.

Looking at the server logs and error messages, there's a ReferenceError in the login endpoint where it's trying to access 'username2' before initialization. Let's fix the login handler in auth.ts:

server/auth.ts
This change:

Extracts username and password from request body first
Validates them using the schema
Prevents the reference error that was causing the 500 error
Try logging in again with your credentials. You should now either get a proper login response or a more specific error message.
