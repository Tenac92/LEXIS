 Database Readiness
 Run test script against Supabase from a server with similar network configuration as production
 Verify all required tables exist in Supabase
 Ensure your Supabase project has proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies set up if used

Deployment Process
7. Deployment Steps
 Create a backup of the current production environment
 Deploy changes in a controlled manner (ideally during low-traffic periods)
 Monitor server startup logs carefully for connection errors
 Test critical application functions after deployment
8. Post-Deployment Verification
 Verify server starts successfully in production
 Check log files for any database connection errors
 Test document creation functionality
 Test user authentication
 Test any other database-dependent features
9. Rollback Plan
 Have a rollback strategy prepared if issues occur
 Know how to restore previous environment variables if needed
 Have previous code deployment available for quick rollback
Performance and Monitoring
10. Ongoing Monitoring
 Set up alerts for database connection failures
 Add additional logging for Supabase operations if needed
 Monitor application performance metrics to identify any changes after migration
11. Firewall and Network Configuration
 Ensure production servers can reach Supabase endpoints
 Check for any firewall rules that might block outgoing connections to Supabase
 Verify any proxy settings if your server operates behind a proxy
Documentation Updates
12. Update Documentation
 Update internal documentation to reflect the move to Supabase-only database
 Document new environment variable requirements
 Update any developer documentation regarding database access
 Document troubleshooting steps for common Supabase connection issues
