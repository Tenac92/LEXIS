# Code Cleanup Documentation

This document describes the cleanup operations performed on the codebase to improve code quality, organization, and handling of edge cases.

## Overview of Changes

### 1. Improved Recipient Data Handling

Fixed potential null/undefined value issues in `DocumentFormatter.ts`:
- Added null checks for recipient properties (firstname, lastname, fathername, afm)
- Improved amount calculations to handle null/undefined amounts
- Ensured consistent handling of recipient data across the application

### 2. File Organization

Restructured the project files for better organization:
- Created `scripts/tests/` directory for all test scripts
- Created `scripts/database/` directory for SQL files
- Created `scripts/patches/` directory for patch files
- Moved redundant fix scripts to `old-patches/` directory
- Moved backup files to `backups/` directory

### 3. Consolidated Fixes

Instead of having multiple patch scripts targeting the same issues, we consolidated fixes in appropriate files:
- Properly fixed recipient name handling in `DocumentFormatter.ts`
- Fixed direct file edits instead of using sed/patch workarounds

## Backup Information

Original backups of critical files have been preserved:
- `server/utils/DocumentFormatter.ts.original`
- `client/src/components/documents/document-modals.tsx.original`
- `client/src/components/documents/orthi-epanalipsi-modal.tsx.original`

## Future Maintenance

When making updates:
1. Focus on defensive coding to handle null/undefined values
2. Consolidate similar changes in single commits
3. Add proper comments explaining complex logic
4. Keep test scripts in the `scripts/tests/` directory
5. Keep database scripts in the `scripts/database/` directory

## Running Tests

All test scripts can be found in the `scripts/tests/` directory. For example:
```bash
node scripts/tests/test-users.js
```
