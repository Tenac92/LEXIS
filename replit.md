## Recent Changes

### July 1, 2025 - Normalized Project Tables Architecture Implementation
- **MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL BREAKTHROUGH: Implemented normalized database structure with separate tables for decisions and formulations**
- Successfully migrated from complex single-table JSONB approach to proper relational design
- **Normalized Tables Structure:**
  - **project_decisions** table: "Αποφάσεις που τεκμηριώνουν το έργο" with 191 migrated records
  - **project_formulations** table: "Στοιχεία κατάρτισης έργου" with 195 migrated records
  - **Foreign Key Relationships**: formulations.decision_id → decisions.id for proper linking
  - **Project Linking**: Both tables connect to projects via project_id foreign keys
- **Migration Success from JSONB Backup:**
  - Analyzed project_history_jsonb_backup structure with decisions and formulation JSONB columns
  - Created clean migration scripts that extract structured data from JSONB fields
  - Successfully populated normalized tables with authentic project data
  - Verified foreign key relationships and data integrity throughout migration
- **Database Design Benefits:**
  - Clean separation of concerns: decisions vs formulations in separate tables
  - Simple SQL queries instead of complex JSONB path operations
  - Proper referential integrity with foreign key constraints
  - Standard relational database practices for better maintainability
  - Enhanced performance with indexed columns on individual fields
- **Comprehensive Edit Form Impact:**
  - Section 1 "Αποφάσεις που τεκμηριώνουν το έργο": Direct queries to project_decisions table
  - Section 4 "Στοιχεία κατάρτισης έργου": Direct queries to project_formulations table
  - Clean API structure: /api/projects/7/decisions and /api/projects/7/formulations
  - Easy CRUD operations: POST, PUT, DELETE for individual decisions and formulations
  - Proper linking: formulations reference specific decisions by ID as requested
- **Technical Excellence:**
  - Follows database normalization principles (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
  - Foreign key cascade deletes for data integrity
  - Atomic transactions for related data operations
  - Future-proof extensibility for additional relationships
- **Files Created:** shared/schema.ts (normalized tables), scripts/clean-migrate-from-backup.js, NORMALIZED_TABLES_SUMMARY.md
