## Overview
This full-stack web application manages Greek government budgets and documents. It enables the management of projects, budget allocations, beneficiaries, and employees, alongside the generation of official government documents. The platform aims to streamline financial oversight and document management for government entities, offering real-time budget tracking, automated quarterly transitions, and comprehensive audit trails. Its ambition is to provide a robust, efficient, and transparent system for public sector financial administration.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The application features a React (TypeScript) frontend utilizing Radix UI, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, and TanStack Query for a modern UI/UX. Routing is handled by React Router. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js (TypeScript), managing sessions with `express-session`, custom authentication with `bcrypt`, and real-time budget updates via `ws` WebSockets. Document generation relies on `docx` and `ExcelJS`.

Core architectural decisions include:
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Specialized dashboards (Admin, Manager, User) provide tailored experiences and access control.
- **Modular Component Design**: Extracted and modularized UI components for maintainability and reusability.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling middleware, `ErrorBoundary` components, and input validation using Zod schemas.
- **Normalized Database Schema**: Transitioned to a highly normalized PostgreSQL schema (Supabase) with separate tables for project decisions, formulations, and history, ensuring data integrity and simplified queries.
- **Standardized Project IDs**: Utilizes numeric `project_id` throughout the system for consistent, efficient data lookups.
- **Performance Optimization**: Employed `useQueries` for parallel data fetching, aggressive React Query caching, and optimized API endpoints to reduce load times.
- **Secure Authentication**: Custom session-based authentication with unit-based access control and secure cookie management.
- **Automated Quarter Transitions**: Scheduled processes manage budget transitions and track spending history.
- **Templated Document Generation**: Supports various Greek government document types with dynamic data population.
- **Multi-select UI**: Implemented multi-select dropdowns for various entities like implementing agencies and expenditure types for enhanced user input.
