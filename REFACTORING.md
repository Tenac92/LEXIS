# Code Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic approach to improving code quality, reducing technical debt, and enhancing maintainability in the project. The refactoring process is ongoing and focuses on addressing several key areas of improvement.

## Completed Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Enhanced Logging
- Replaced console.log statements with structured logging using a centralized logger module
- Added context-based logging with component/module identification
- Implemented log levels (info, warn, error, debug) for better filtering and analysis

### 2. Breaking Down Large Files
- Split DocumentFormatter.ts (2381 lines) into smaller, focused utilities:
  - SafeDataHelpers.ts - For safely handling null/undefined values
  - TableFormatter.ts - For table creation and formatting
  - RecipientFormatter.ts - For recipient data handling
  - HeaderFormatter.ts - For document header generation
  - DocumentHelpers.ts - For common document utilities

### 3. Code Quality Tools
- Fixed code-check.js to work with ES modules
- Enhanced error handling in utility scripts
- Created automated tools to assist with refactoring:
  - replace-console-logs.js - For systematically replacing console.log statements
  - split-large-file.js - For breaking down large files
  - update-imports.js - For updating import paths after file restructuring

### 4. Import Path Standardization
- Fixed inconsistent import paths across the codebase
- Ensured proper imports for the logger module in all files

## Ongoing Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Type Safety Improvements
- Addressing type errors in utility files (TableFormatter.ts, HeaderFormatter.ts)
- Adding proper TypeScript interfaces for document generation

### 2. Error Handling
- Improving error handling across the application
- Adding try/catch blocks around critical operations
- Adding proper fallbacks for edge cases

### 3. Additional File Splitting
- Continue breaking down large files (>500 lines) for better maintainability
- Target files:
  - drizzle.ts
  - authentication.ts
  - budgetController.ts

## Future Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Test Coverage
- Add unit tests for core utilities
- Implement integration tests for critical workflows

### 2. Code Documentation
- Improve JSDoc comments across the codebase
- Add comprehensive documentation for public APIs

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Identify and optimize slow database queries
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize document generation process

## Best Practices Established

1. **Null Safety** - Always check for null/undefined values before accessing properties
2. **Structured Logging** - Use the logger module instead of console.log
3. **File Size** - Keep files under 500 lines of code
4. **Error Handling** - Use try/catch and provide meaningful error messages
5. **Type Safety** - Leverage TypeScript's type system to catch errors early

## How to Contribute to Refactoring

1. Use the code quality tools in the scripts directory
2. Follow the established best practices
3. Document any technical debt discovered
4. Update this document with completed refactoring tasks
