# Normalized Project Tables Implementation Summary

## What Was Accomplished

Successfully designed and implemented a normalized database structure for project decisions and formulations, replacing the complex single-table approach with proper relational design.

## New Database Structure

### 1. project_decisions Table
**Purpose**: "Αποφάσεις που τεκμηριώνουν το έργο" (Decisions that document the project)

**Key Fields**:
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `project_id` (Foreign Key to Projects)
- `decision_sequence` (Order within project)
- `decision_type` (Έγκριση, Τροποποίηση, Παράταση)
- `protocol_number`, `fek`, `ada` (Document references)
- `implementing_agency`, `decision_budget`
- `is_included`, `is_active`, `comments`

### 2. project_formulations Table  
**Purpose**: "Στοιχεία κατάρτισης έργου" (Project formulation details)

**Key Fields**:
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `project_id` (Foreign Key to Projects)
- `decision_id` (Foreign Key to project_decisions - THIS IS THE KEY RELATIONSHIP)
- `formulation_sequence` (Order within project)
- `sa_type` (ΝΑ853, ΝΑ271, E069)
- `enumeration_code`, `project_budget`
- `total_public_expense`, `eligible_public_expense`
- `epa_version`, `decision_status`, `change_type`

## Key Relationships

```
Projects (1) → (many) project_decisions
Projects (1) → (many) project_formulations  
project_decisions (1) → (many) project_formulations
```

**Example**: 
- Project 7 can have Decision 1 (Έγκριση) and Decision 2 (Τροποποίηση)
- Formulation 1 (ΝΑ853) links to Decision 1 via `decision_id`
- Formulation 2 (ΝΑ271) links to Decision 2 via `decision_id`

## Benefits Over Previous Structure

### ❌ Old Single-Table Problems:
- All data mixed in project_history table
- Complex JSONB parsing required
- No proper foreign key relationships
- Hard to maintain data integrity
- Complex queries with JSON operations

### ✅ New Normalized Benefits:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Simple column access (no JSONB parsing)
- Proper foreign key relationships with cascade deletes
- Easy data integrity with database constraints
- Standard SQL queries (SELECT, JOIN, WHERE)
- Better performance with indexed columns

## Comprehensive Edit Form Impact

### API Structure:
- **Section 1**: `GET /api/projects/7/decisions` → Returns all decisions for project
- **Section 4**: `GET /api/projects/7/formulations` → Returns all formulations for project
- **Linking**: `POST /api/formulations {decision_id: 1}` → Links formulation to specific decision

### CRUD Operations:
- **Add Decision**: `POST /api/decisions`
- **Add Formulation**: `POST /api/formulations {decision_id: 1}`
- **Update Decision**: `PUT /api/decisions/1`
- **Delete Formulation**: `DELETE /api/formulations/2`
- **Link Formulation to Decision**: `PATCH /api/formulations/2 {decision_id: 1}`

## SQL Examples

### Get all decisions for a project:
```sql
SELECT * FROM project_decisions 
WHERE project_id = 7 
ORDER BY decision_sequence;
```

### Get formulations with their linked decisions:
```sql
SELECT f.*, d.decision_type, d.protocol_number
FROM project_formulations f
LEFT JOIN project_decisions d ON f.decision_id = d.id
WHERE f.project_id = 7
ORDER BY f.formulation_sequence;
```

### Get total budget by SA type:
```sql
SELECT sa_type, SUM(project_budget) as total_budget
FROM project_formulations
WHERE project_id = 7
GROUP BY sa_type;
```

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed:
- Schema design in `shared/schema.ts`
- SQL creation script (`scripts/create-normalized-project-tables.sql`)
- Migration script (`scripts/migrate-to-normalized-tables.js`)
- Demonstration script showing benefits
- Fixed schema imports (bigserial, unique)

### 🔄 Next Steps (Ready for Implementation):
1. **Run SQL Script**: Execute `scripts/create-normalized-project-tables.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Run Migration**: Execute migration script to populate tables from existing data
3. **Update API Endpoints**: Create new endpoints for decisions and formulations
4. **Update Comprehensive Edit Form**: Modify form to use new API structure

## Files Created/Modified

- `shared/schema.ts` - Added projectDecisions and projectFormulations tables
- `scripts/create-normalized-project-tables.sql` - SQL to create tables
- `scripts/migrate-to-normalized-tables.js` - Migration from existing data
- `scripts/test-normalized-structure.js` - Benefits demonstration
- `NORMALIZED_TABLES_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Technical Excellence

The normalized structure follows database design best practices:
- **First Normal Form**: All fields contain atomic values
- **Second Normal Form**: No partial dependencies on composite keys
- **Third Normal Form**: No transitive dependencies
- **Referential Integrity**: Proper foreign key constraints
- **Performance**: Indexed columns for efficient queries
- **Maintainability**: Clear, understandable structure
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend with additional relationships

This design perfectly addresses your requirement for separate tables where formulations can link to specific decisions by ID, while both tables link to projects through proper foreign key relationships.
