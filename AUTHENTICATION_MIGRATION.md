# Authentication Migration to Supabase

## Overview

This document outlines the authentication system migration from the previous PostgreSQL-based implementation to Supabase. The migration introduces a more robust and resilient authentication system with improved error handling and session management.

## Key Changes

### 1. Session Management

- Replaced PostgreSQL-based session store with MemoryStore
- Eliminated `connect-pg-simple` dependency causing session pruning errors
- Enhanced cookie settings for cross-domain support with sdegdaefk.gr
- Added proper session expiration handling and cleanup

### 2. Authentication Flow

- Updated user authentication to use Supabase directly
- Enhanced password verification with support for both `password` and `password_hash` fields
- Implemented proper session sanitization to remove sensitive fields
- Added detailed error logging for authentication failures

### 3. Error Handling

- Added specialized middleware for Supabase database errors
- Implemented connection recovery mechanisms
- Enhanced error responses with proper status codes and messages

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Process

The authentication system now follows this workflow:

1. User submits login credentials (email/password)
2. System fetches user from Supabase database
3. Password is verified using bcrypt
4. Session is created with sanitized user data
5. User data is returned to client

### Session Structure

Sessions now store:
- Basic user information (id, email, name, role)
- Optional user metadata (units, department, telephone)
- Session creation timestamp

### Error Recovery

The system now has built-in recovery mechanisms:
- Automatic reconnection to Supabase on connection errors
- Enhanced diagnostics for authentication failures
- Proper session cleanup on errors

## Testing

Use the included test scripts to verify authentication functionality:

```bash
# Test Supabase connection
node check-supabase-connection.js

# Test authentication system 
node test-auth.js
```

## Benefits

- Eliminated "Failed to prune sessions" errors
- Resolved "password authentication failed" issues
- Improved reliability of cross-domain authentication
- Enhanced security through proper session sanitization
- Better error diagnostics and recovery
